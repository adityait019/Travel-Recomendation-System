# Travel Recommendation System

## Overview

Welcome to the Travel Recommendation System project! This system is designed to provide personalized recommendations 
for hotels, restaurants, and travel places based on user preferences and location. Leveraging Flask for web development, 
Pandas for data analysis, and a RandomForest Regressor model for predictions, the system aims to enhance the travel experience for users.

## Features

- **Personalized Recommendations:** The system employs a RandomForest Regressor model to predict user preferences for hotels, restaurants, and travel places.
  
- **Geospatial Analysis:** GeoPandas and Shapely are used to incorporate geospatial features, offering location-specific suggestions for an enriched user experience.

- **User Interaction:** The recommendation system is integrated into a Flask web application, allowing users to easily interact with and receive personalized travel suggestions.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Web Development:** Flask
- **Data Analysis and Machine Learning:** Pandas, Scikit-learn
- **Geospatial Analysis:** GeoPandas, Shapely
- **Geocoding:** ArcGIS, Geopy
